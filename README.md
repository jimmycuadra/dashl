# Dashl

**Dashl** is a dashboard app to be displayed on a Raspberry Pi kiosk I have set up in my home.
The plan is to include the following widgets:

* Countdown timer
* Local weather
* Kubernetes cluster metrics
* Status of apps currently deployed to the Kubernetes cluster

## Usage

Copy `js/config.sample.js` to `js/config.js` and fill in the values you want.
Then open `index.html` in a browser.
